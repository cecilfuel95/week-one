//It's been one week since you looked at me
//Cocked your head to the side and said I'm angry
//Five days since you laughed at me saying
//Get that together come back and see me
//Three days since the living room
//I realized it's all my fault but couldn't tell you
//Yesterday you'd forgiven me
//But it'll still be two days 'til I say I'm sorry
